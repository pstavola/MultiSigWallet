# Multi-Sig Wallet


A multi-sig wallet with the typical functionalities:  
    - submit transactions  
    - approve pending transactions  
    - revoke pending transactions  
    - execute pending transactions after minimum number of approvals has been reached  
  
Only owners can trigger these functions.  
     
  
Implementation has been inspired by [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/app/multi-sig-wallet/), I copy/pasted events from it and then continued on my own. After successfull testing I did a final comparison with Solidity by Example and implemented a few improvements/clean-ups.
